# Fashion Mnist project 


# Phase 1: 
Set up a notebook with dataset and preprocess the data and apply the convolutional neural networks for image classification. 

Using this CNN architecture our model able to predict the image of which category it belongs to. 

# Phase 2: 

In this phase save the model for further usage and create a directory called **app** and setup streamlit environment to deploy it. 

# Phase 3: 

Create a setup using Streamlit environment which takes image from user and predict the category of image. 

# Phase 4: 

To run streamlit in separate environment, create an virtual environment

if you have anaconda : 
  create environment using  **conda create venv_name** 
After successful creation of environment using  **conda activate venv_name**
To deactivate environment **conda deactivate**

To install all the libraries requrired (which are already placed in requirements.txt)
**pip install -r requirements.txt**
To run file main.py : 
**python main.py**
After successful execution: 
**streamlit run main.py**
To stop/terminate server: 
**control+c**
